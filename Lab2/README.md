# Lab 2
## Introduction
The lab is made in collaboration with Halmstad University, in the course "Artificial Intelligence for Health", course code: DT8029.
During this lab the student becomes familiar with the preprocessing part of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans of the human brain. 
This by using the Matlab library Statistical Parameter Mapping (SPM) which grants a quick and easy visualization of the images. 
The second part of the lab was to classify between healthy and neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimerâ€™s. 
Last part of the lab was to visualize what the model had learned and understand their choices. 
This by plotting the activation's of the convolutional layers, plot the weights of the fully connected layers, explaining model decisions using SHAP and visualizing saliency maps.
